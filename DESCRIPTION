Description: Starting 2020-04-24 and continuing until 2022-11-14, when they were
    shut down due to a lack of funding, the Sykdomspulsen team from the 
    Norwegian Institute of Public Health automatically published machine-friendly
    COVID-19 data updates on weekdays at 13:15. These updates included information
    on case numbers, ICU/hospital admissions, deaths, testing, and vaccinations.
    This package cleans and merges the publically available datasets into
    analysis-ready datasets.
