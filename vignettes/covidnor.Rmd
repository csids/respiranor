Starting 2020-04-24 and continuing until 2022-11-14, when they were shut down due to a lack of funding, the Sykdomspulsen team from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health automatically published [machine-friendly COVID-19 data updates](http://github.com/folkehelseinstituttet/surveillance_data) on weekdays at 13:15. These updates included information on case numbers, ICU/hospital admissions, deaths, testing, and vaccinations.

[covidnor](https://www.csids.no/covidnor/) cleans and merges the publically available datasets into analysis-ready datasets.
